# Reading Time Pies

Allows a Readmill user view their reading statistics by viewing their reading times in a pie chart. Each book is divided into a pie slice to show the percentage of total reading time for each book. The user is able to drill down into each book in their library to see more details about the reading statistics for each given book. Also displays highlights for each book the user had read. This is a work in progress.
